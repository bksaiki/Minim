Version 0.3.5
26 Feburary 2022
Added:
 - default build uses Boehm GC
 - cleanup
Internals:
 - new bootstrap interpreter
   - minimal Scheme interpreter in C
   - small standard library

Version 0.3.4
5 May 2022
Added:
 - primitive record procedures
    - records are now primitive types
    - most record manipulation done through macros
 - additional sequence manipulation
    - sequences are no longer primitives
    - implemented using records
Internals:
 - simpler garbage collector
 - separate expander pass
 - module vs. module instantiation
    - one module per file during runtime
    - module instance every time a file is imported
 - compiler to pseudoassembly
    - translation to flat syntax
    - optimization passes
    - register allocation
 - partial support for native function calling (more to come!!!)

Version 0.3.3
29 November 2021
Internal:
 - file caching
 - symbol tables and hash tables implemented with linked list buckets
 - syntax objects are just wrappers on Minim objects
 - tail calling via longjumps
 - symbol interning
 - symbol table lookup done by pointer comparison

Version 0.3.2
18 September 2021
Added:
 - control: call/cc, case-lambda
 - macros: with-syntax
 - type: record
 - other: list library, file I/O, string/number conversion
Internal:
 - exit and errors implemented as jumps
 - better macro system (closer to R6RS compliance)
 - parser consumes from port object

Version 0.3.1
14 August 2021
Added:
 - files organized as modules for exporting and importing symbols
 - multiple value expressions
 - characters (all R4RS procedures)
 - additional string procedures
Internal:
 - move many builtins to standard library
 - move sequences to library
Removed:
 - iterators

Version 0.3.0
27 July 2021
Added:
 - quasiquoting/unquoting
 - syntax macros with 'def-syntax'
 - lazy evaluation with 'delay' and 'force'
 - few missing procedures
Major internal changes:
 - switched to a simple garbage collector
 - tail call optimization
Fixes (as usual)

Version 0.2.2
17 March 2021
Added more list functions: accessors, maps, etc.
Expanded standard library
Better parser

Version 0.2.1
27 March 2021
Added many number/math functions: trigonometric, rounding, number theory
Added verbose arity, argument errors

Version 0.2.0
26 February 2021
Added file reading, errors with backtracing and file locations, and a small
standard library with five functions. Three new functions: 'error', 'foldl',
and 'foldr'.

Version 0.1.2
15 January 2021
Added vectors, mutable hash operators. Objects can be passed by
reference. Better parsing.

Version 0.1.1
23 December 2020
Added strings, hash-tables, sequences, printing, and equivalence.

Version 0.1.0
27 October 2020
First release. Minimal support for lists, pairs, numbers, lambdas,
symbols. Command line only (multi-line input). Only tested on Linux.
